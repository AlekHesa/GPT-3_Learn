Prioritize self-care and make time for activities that bring you joy. Focus on positive self-talk, and practice self-compassion when things don't go as planned. Remember to set boundaries and say 'no' when needed, and surround yourself with people who support and uplift you. Lastly, practice gratitude and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small they may seem.
